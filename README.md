# What is this?
These are the project files and built level (in Output folder) for a Beat Saber level i worked on but never finished

The mapping is a first draft with many many problems. The visuals have been worked on quite a bit but didn't look good enough to my eyes, i couldn't figure out what i can do to make them "good enough" so i've not finished it.

# Why is it uploaded
So others can learn from my projects and improve their own maps.
